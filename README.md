Geometric Brownian Motion for Stock Market Prediction
# Introduction
Brownian motion is a fundamental concept in stochastic processes, reprenting the random movement of particles, as first observed by botanist Robert Brown. This random behavior is mathematically modeled as a continuous-time stochastic process, ccharacterized by unpredictability. In finance, Brownian motion forms the basis for modeling the random fluctuations of asset prices over time. 
Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) extends this idea to financial modeling, where it is used to represent the stochastic behavior of stock prices. GBM has both a deterministic trend (drift) and a random component (volatility), thus capturing the features of a real-world dynamic. GBM represents a mathematical foundation for option pricing models such as Black-Scholes, risk management strategies and simulation of asset prices.
The mathematical formulation of GBM is expressed by the following equation:
{\displaystyle dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}\,dt+\sigma S_{t}\,dW_{t}}

The following project will cover the implementation of simulations and analysis of the results.
